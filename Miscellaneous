                print(data)
file_read('test.txt')


Math Module:

Q1. Write a Python program to convert degree to radian.

  return (deg * pi) / 180.0
print(degrees_to_rads(180))
print(degrees_to_rads(90))


Q2. Write a python program to find the area of a circle.

Code:
from math import pi
def circle(radius):
  return pi*radius*radius
  
Q3. Write a Python program to find the value of ln x using log x from math module.


Code:
import math
x=int(input("enter the integer:"))
lnx=2.303*(math.log(x))
print(lnx)

Q4. Write a python program to find the tangent of a given number.

Code:
import math as m:
x=int(input("enter the number"))
tanx=m.tan(x)
print(tanx)

Q5. two functions can have same values at two different points check whether sin and cos functions have same values at 60?

Code:
import math
if math.sin(60)==math.cos(60):
  print('Same")
 else:
  print("Different")
  
  Random Module:
  
  Q1. Write a Python program to generate a random alphabetical character, alphabetical string and alphabetical string of a fixed length.
  
  Code:
import random
import string
print("Generate a random alphabetical character:")
print(random.choice(string.ascii_letters))
print("\nGenerate a random alphabetical string:")
max_length = 255
str1 = ""
for i in range(random.randint(1, max_length)):
    str1 += random.choice(string.ascii_letters)
print(str1)
print("\nGenerate a random alphabetical string of a fixed length:")
str1 = ""
for i in range(10):
    str1 += random.choice(string.ascii_letters)
print(str1)

Q2. Write a Python program to construct a seeded random number generator, also generate a float between 0 and 1, excluding 1.

Code:
import random
print("Construct a seeded random number generator:")
print(random.Random().random())
print(random.Random(0).random())
print("\nGenerate a float between 0 and 1, excluding 1:")
print(random.random())

Q3. Write a Python program to generate a random integer between 0 and 6 - excluding 6, random integer between 5 and 10 - excluding 10, random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3 and random date between two dates.

Code:
import random
import datetime
print("Generate a random integer between 0 and 6:")
print(random.randrange(5))
print("Generate random integer between 5 and 10, excluding 10:")
print(random.randrange(start=5, stop=10))
print("Generate random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3:")
print(random.randrange(start=0, stop=10, step=3))
print("\nRandom date between two dates:")
start_dt = datetime.date(2019, 2, 1)
end_dt = datetime.date(2019, 3, 1)
time_between_dates = end_dt - start_dt
days_between_dates = time_between_dates.days
random_number_of_days = random.randrange(days_between_dates)
random_date = start_dt + datetime.timedelta(days=random_number_of_days)
print(random_date)

Q4. Write a python program to generate a random color from a list of colors.

Code:
import random
l=['red','yellow','green','blue']
random_num = random.choice(l)
print(random_num)

Q5. Write a python program to shuffle a list.

Code:
import random

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
random.shuffle(mylist)

print(mylist) 


Exception Handling

Q1. Write the python code to show exception for writting a file which is readable only.

Code:
try:
   fh = open("testfile", "r")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print "Error: can\'t find file or read data"
else:
   print "Written content in the file successfully"
   
 Q2. Write a Python program to print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors.
 
 Code:
 try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
  print("Something else went wrong") 
  
  Q3. Write a Python program to raise a TypeError if x is not an integer.
  
  Code:
  x = "hello"

if not type(x) is int:
  raise TypeError("Only integers are allowed") 
  
 Q4. Write a python program to raise an error and stop the program if x is lower than 0.
 
 Code:
 x = -1

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero") 
  
  Q5. Write try except block for zero division error.

Code:
 a = 5
 b = 0
 try:
    print(a/b)
 except ZeroDivisionError:
    print(“You can’t divide with 0”)
